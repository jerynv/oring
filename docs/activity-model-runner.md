# Running Oura's activity-detection model on our data

`tools/run_activity_model.py` feeds our stored ring events into Oura's decrypted
TorchScript `automatic_activity_detection_3_1_11.pt` and prints detected activity
segments — **no raw IMU / RData needed**, it runs on the windowed signals we
already sync.

**This is the engine behind `oura sessions`.** The Rust CLI no longer ships a
temperature/MET heuristic; `oura sessions` shells out to this script (it locates
the repo's `.venv/bin/python`, falling back to `python3`). Use the CLI for the
normal path and this script directly for `--json`, `--verbose`, or a custom
`--threshold`/`--min-duration`.

```
python tools/run_activity_model.py [DB] [--tz HOURS] [--threshold P] [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--json]
oura sessions --tz-offset 1            # same thing, via the CLI
```
`DB` defaults to `./oura.db` then `captures/ring5.db`. Requires `torch` (CPU is
fine) in the venv. The model lives in `notes/models/`.

## In-process (Rust + LibTorch, no Python at runtime)

Built with `--features torch`, `oura sessions` can run the base model in-process via
the `tch` crate. That legacy path does not yet run `steps_motion_decoder`; use the
default Python-backed command (and the web dashboard, which uses it) for the
Android-parity labels documented here.

On Apple Silicon the only libtorch is the pip wheel, so the repo **venv is aligned
to torch 2.9.0** (Python 3.11) — the exact version `tch 0.22` targets — and we link
against it with **no version-check bypass**:

```
export PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH"
export LIBTORCH_USE_PYTORCH=1
cargo build --features torch
oura sessions --tz-offset 1     # no DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH needed — build.rs bakes the rpath
```

`build.rs` embeds the venv torch `lib/` as an rpath, so the binary loads
`libtorch_*.dylib` without `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. The default build (no feature)
needs no libtorch and keeps using the Python runner. Note LibTorch prints a
one-time `searchsorted` perf warning to stderr (harmless; stdout/JSON stay clean).

Version coupling: `tch X` pins one exact libtorch (0.20→2.7, 0.22→2.9, 0.24→2.11);
there is **no 2.8 release**. The venv torch must match the `tch` pin, and torch
≥2.9 needs Python ≥3.10. If you bump either, bump both together.

## Android parity

The decompiled Android app uses this same 3.1.11 model. Its important preprocessing
steps are now mirrored here and in iOS:

- one inference per local calendar day; model time is minutes since local midnight;
- a 10-minute minimum duration;
- all three gait sub-windows from `steps_motion_decoder_2_0_0`;
- the decoder's columns reordered through Android's `StepMotionFeature` schema.

The ring exposes the decoder input directly as paired `real_step` events (0x7e/0x7f),
so raw RData is not required. On a retained Ring 5 replay this changes a known hike
from `cycling` 0.45 to `hiking` 0.97, while a known bike remains `cycling` 0.92 and
an immersion interval is classified `swimming` 0.99.

## Days the model cannot evaluate

Two input shapes make AAD 3.1.11 throw inside its preprocessor instead of returning no
workouts, so both runners (`tools/run_activity_model.py` and iOS `ActivityModel`) guard
them identically:

- **A channel with no sample inside the MET span.** The model clips every series to its
  valid window and then indexes the (now empty) tensor. A NaN placeholder row is placed
  at the *first MET minute* (not at minute 0) so the channel stays present and is treated
  as missing data.
- **Fewer than 10 worn MET minutes before the last motion sample** (`min_valid_mets`,
  `non_wear_met_threshold = 0.2`). The valid window collapses to minute 0 and `met[0, 0]`
  is read from an empty tensor when the day's MET starts later. `model_would_reject` /
  `isDegenerate` mirror `get_last_valid_time` and return no sessions for such a day.
- **Duplicate MET minutes** (the ring resends a bucket across a clock re-anchor) trip the
  resampler with `index_copy_()`; both runners keep one value per minute, last write wins.

On iOS a day the model still rejects is cached as failed under its input fingerprint and
skipped, so one bad day never blocks the rest of the history or reruns on every launch.

## I/O contract (as implemented)

forward args (TorchScript order): `context, user, met, stepmotion, motion,
temperature, heartrate, location=None, past_activities=None, probability_threshold,
minimum_duration_minutes, allow_non_wear`.

All series are float32 2-D, **column 0 = time in minutes** on one shared axis.

| input | cols | source (decoded events) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| met | `[t, met]` | 0x50 `met[]` (1 value/min, expanded) |
| motion | `[t, orient, motion_s, ax, ay, az, NaN(regular_motion), low_int, high_int]` | 0x47 |
| temperature | `[t, temps_c[0]]` | 0x46 |
| heartrate | `[t, mean(hr_bpm)]` | 0x80 |
| stepmotion | 12 cols — timestamp + 11 gait features | paired 0x7e/0x7f → `steps_motion_decoder` |

Output `workouts[n,9]` = `[start_min, end_min, is_workout_prob, id1,p1, id2,p2,
id3,p3]` (corrected from the spec, which called col 2 "duration"). `id`→name via
the behavior table in the script (swimming=13, walking=14, cycling=5, …).

## Gotchas learned the hard way

- **Run each day independently.** This is both the Android contract and keeps the
  minute axis exactly representable in float32.
- **Decoder order is not AAD order.** `steps_motion_decoder` emits
  `sum,y,z,total,strideFreq,…`; Android's `px.b` maps that to
  `firstFreq,firstAmp,high,mid,gait,…,sum,total,y,z` before AAD.
- **stepmotion boundary rows must span the day's MET range.** The model derives
  `last_valid_time` from every series; missing boundaries can truncate a day.
- **Ring `ring_timestamp` is device-relative deciseconds**, not unix — anchor to
  the latest event's `captured_unix` (as `oura sessions` does).
- Open calibration unknowns: ACM `avg_*` scaling (env `ACM_SCALE`, default 1) and
  temperature-probe choice (using index 0).

GPS and past-activity inputs are still absent, so sports without gait can remain
ambiguous. `--no-stepmotion` exists only to compare against the old partial pipeline.
