"""Reconstruct ALL three Oura daily scores (Sleep, Readiness, Activity) end-to-end
from raw metrics in a trends export — the same two-layer approach as Sleep:

  weights (round(Σ wᵢ·subᵢ/100), tools/fit_scores.py)  ×  contributor curves.

Readiness/Activity differ from Sleep: several contributors are **baseline-relative**
(HRV Balance, Resting HR, Sleep/Activity Balance) or **sequential** (Previous Night,
Previous Day Activity, Training Frequency/Volume). We engineer lag-1 and trailing-
mean features so a linear fit can form "today vs personal baseline"; what stays low
is what genuinely needs accumulated history the export can't encode statically.

Reports per-contributor and end-to-end held-out R² for each score:
  ceiling  = weights × Oura's actual sub-scores
  achieved = weights × our sub-scores predicted from raw metrics

Usage: python tools/fit_scores_all.py [CSV]
